              <li><h2>Importance of LMS</h2>
              <p>With a fully automated LMS, you can easily create training courses for your staff, add exams to the course curriculum, set up a pass rate for the exams and issue certificates if the person passes the final exam and a lot more. You can also add pre-recorded videos of lectures or classes to your course, images and audio files.</p>
              <p>So, instead of taking time every month, semester, or year to train your staff, gathering everybody together in a room and teaching them a class or giving them a lecture, then giving a paper-based exam that needs to be graded manually afterwards – which takes up everybody’s time and a lot of company money (that’s why a lot of companies skip that part, but, since you are reading this, I’m sure you are not one of them)  –  you can save a lot of time and money by using an LMS to create the courses and exams once, share them online with your staff, and having the team take the training using their own devices (during work hours or not). The exams are graded automatically, and you’ll receive an email notifying you when someone completes a course or exam. Much easier, right?</p>
              </li>
              <li><h2>Objective of LMS</h2>
              <p>The main objective of an LMS is to manage the learning process (the name Learning Management System is pretty much self-explanatory). It is a system because it works in an automated, pre-determined way. Or we could say system is a fancy word for software. Whatever you prefer. Basically, Learning Management Systems were created to make your life (and your staff’s) easier. And we, from Easy LMS, want to make it even more easier, because our LMS software (as the name says) is very intuitive and easy to use. Nope, there’s no need to be a techie to start creating awesome courses and exams. All you need is to have a computer, Internet, be able to use both, and you’re all set! Start creating your first course now and see for yourself!</p>
              <p>In today’s fast-paced work environment, organizations and companies need to keep their team up to speed with the latest trends and methods for each industry.</p>
